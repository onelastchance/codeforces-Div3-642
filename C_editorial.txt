It is intuitive (and provable) that the best strategy is to move each figure to the center cell (n+12,n+12). Now, with some paperwork or easy observations, we can notice that we have exactly 8 cells with the shortest distance 1, 16 cells with the shortest distance 2, 24 cells with the shortest distance 3 and so on. So we have 8i cells with the shortest distance i. So the answer is 1⋅8+2⋅16+3⋅24+⋯+(n−12)2⋅8. It can be rewritten as 8(1+4+9+⋯+(n−12)2) so we can just calculate the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to n−12 using loop (or formula n(n+1)(2n+1)6) and multiply the answer by 8.

Time complexity: O(n) or O(1).
